# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework for building modern web applications. This
guide will help you get started with Next.js development.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several benefits that make it a popular choice for React
developers:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improved performance and SEO
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time
- **Automatic Routing**: File-system based routing
- **API Routes**: Built-in API endpoints
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, TypeScript support, and more

## Setting Up a Next.js Project

Get started with a new Next.js project by running:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Basic Project Structure

```
my-app/
├── app/              # App Router
├── components/       # Reusable components
├── lib/              # Utility functions
├── public/           # Static assets
├── next.config.js    # Next.js configuration
└── package.json      # Project dependencies
```

## Creating a Simple Page

```tsx
// app/page.tsx
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js!</h1>
      <p>This is a simple Next.js page.</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Next.js makes web development a breeze with its intuitive API and powerful
features.
