# How to Use MCP

Welcome to the guide on using Figma's MCP (Material Component Platform). This
blog post will introduce you to the basics of working with MCP and how to
integrate it into your workflow.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Material Component Platform) is a design system tool for creating
consistent UI components that can be easily implemented in your projects. It
provides a standardized approach to design, allowing for faster development and
more consistent user interfaces.

## Key Features

- **Component Libraries**: Access to pre-built, customizable components
- **Design Tokens**: Manage design variables like colors and typography
- **Version Control**: Track changes to your design system
- **Integration**: Easy implementation with various development frameworks

## Getting Started

To begin using MCP, you'll need to:

1. Set up a Figma account
2. Access the MCP plugin
3. Initialize your design system
4. Create or import components

## Code Example

```tsx
// Example of using MCP components in React
import {Button, Card} from '@figma/mcp-react'

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <h2>Hello MCP</h2>
      <Button variant="primary">Click Me</Button>
    </Card>
  )
}
```
