# Figma MCP Tools

- Always try to implement the result using ShadCN UI component (if any, prefer install ShadCN UI automatically using `bunx --bun shadcn@latest add [something]` command)
- The default runtime is using `bun` or `bunx`
- Use `cn` from [utils.ts](mdc:src/lib/utils.ts) if want to implement dynamic classes
- Always make the generation result to be pixel perfect, but make the layout fluid and mobile first (responsive), don't forget to utilize container or max width too
- Use placehold.co for dummy images
- Alternative text title element cannot be empty
- Avoid using the index of an array as key property in an element
